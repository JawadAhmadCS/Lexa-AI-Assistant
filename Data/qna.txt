what is my most awkward blender scene embarrassment of my life :you liked a girl and sent her a friend request on Snapchat.After two days, you took a screenshot of her profile, and she received a notification about it. The awkward part is that this happened at night 2 AM, and you also canceled the friend request at that same time.
